You are reviewing Go code for API design issues.

## Function: {{.Name}}
Package: {{.Package}}
{{if .Receiver}}Receiver: {{.Receiver}}{{end}}
Signature: {{.Signature}}
{{if .Godoc}}Documentation: {{.Godoc}}{{end}}

```go

{{if .Summary}}
## Function Summary
Purpose: {{.Summary.Purpose}}
Behavior: {{.Summary.Behavior}}
{{end}}

Look for:
- Exported functions without documentation
- Inconsistent naming (mixedCase vs under_score, abbreviations)
- Too many parameters (consider options struct)
- Returning concrete types instead of interfaces
- Overly broad interfaces (accept interfaces, return structs)
- Boolean parameters that reduce readability
- Functions that do too many things (violate single responsibility)
- Unclear return value semantics (when is error nil?)
- Missing error types for distinguishable errors
- Context not as first parameter when needed
- Unexported types in exported function signatures
- Stutter in names (package user with func UserNew)
