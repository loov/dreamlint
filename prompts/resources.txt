Look for:
- Unclosed files, connections, or response bodies
- Missing defer for cleanup operations
- defer in loops (defers accumulate until function returns)
- Context not passed to cancellable operations
- Context cancellation not checked in long loops
- Resources not released on error paths
- Connection pools not configured or bounded
- Missing timeouts on network operations
- Unbounded queues or channels
- Memory not released (holding references unnecessarily)
- Temporary files not cleaned up
- Database transactions not committed or rolled back
